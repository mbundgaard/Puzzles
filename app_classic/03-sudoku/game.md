# Sudoku

## Official Rules

### Grid
- 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 boxes (regions)

### Objective
Fill each cell with digits 1-9 such that:
1. Each row contains digits 1-9 with no repeats
2. Each column contains digits 1-9 with no repeats
3. Each 3x3 box contains digits 1-9 with no repeats

### Properties
- Valid Sudoku puzzles have exactly one solution
- Solvable by logic alone without guessing

## Implementation Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 9x9 grid | Correct | With 3x3 boxes |
| Row uniqueness | Correct | Validated in generation |
| Column uniqueness | Correct | Validated in generation |
| Box uniqueness | Correct | Validated in generation |
| Difficulty levels | Correct | Easy (35), Medium (45), Hard (55) cells removed |
| Unique solution | Not guaranteed | Random cell removal |
| Pencil marks | Missing | No note-taking feature |
| Error highlighting | Missing | Only checked at completion |
| Undo/Redo | Missing | No move history |

## Deviations from Standard Rules

1. **No unique solution guarantee**: Puzzles are generated by creating a valid solution then randomly removing cells. This does not guarantee a unique solution - some puzzles may have multiple valid completions.

2. **No pencil marks**: Players cannot make notes in cells, which is a common feature in Sudoku applications.

3. **No real-time error detection**: Invalid entries are only detected when checking the final solution, not during play.

## Known Issues

- Generated puzzles may have multiple solutions (violates standard Sudoku rules)
- No way to verify if a puzzle is solvable by logic alone
